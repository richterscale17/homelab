Hey, there!

I’m Zach, and I’m passionate about tech for IT Pros and Homelab nerds.

Why am I doing all this? Because I just have a genuine love for IT and sharing my knowledge with others. I believe that by presenting what I've learned, I can inspire people to explore and experiment with technology themselves.![homenetwork(2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a78f519-c62c-4d28-8fd5-d6db023a7e46)
